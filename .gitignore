# Model and data files that are too large or should not be versioned
# Consider if you want to version the .pkl file or just the training script.
# For simplicity in this project, we might include the .pkl if it's small enough for GitHub's limits.
# If your .pkl is very large (e.g., >100MB), you'll need Git LFS.
# For now, let's include it assuming it's reasonably sized.
# random_forest_pipeline.pkl  # Uncomment this line if you want to IGNORE the model file
# financing_approval_balanced_dataset_Tunisia_with_interactions.csv # Uncomment if you want to IGNORE the dataset
